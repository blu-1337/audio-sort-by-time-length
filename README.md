# audio-sort-by-time-length
Sort your audio file by lenght of the audio into folders.


# Prerequisites
1. python
  *//download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. pip install scipy //run this command in cmd (on Windows, for example)

# How To Use

1. Place the "sort_audio_files.py" script in the same folder you have your .wav files that you want to sort.
2. Run the "sort_audio_files.py" script. This will create two folder "long" and "short" and will move the .wav files inside of them. If the .wav is longer than 3s it will go to "long", if it's shorter then it will go to "short"
